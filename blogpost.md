## How has my understanding of CS changed?
In CSE 142 and CSE 143, I think what we learned was more focused on writing codes from scratch and learning the basics of java. But in CSE 373 things changed. Since we have mastered java basics in previous classes, now we start to learn data structures and algorithms and what we do is apply it to the java knowledge we have in mind.  

My understanding of CS changed when I started working on the projects of CSE 373. It is my first exposure to this kind of large project since I started learning computer science. It is a lot larger than the codes we met, and we need to implement some of them so that the program can run smoothly. The runtime analysis progress is kind of fun for me but it's also head-scratching because we need to analyze every sub-part of the codes and then combine the runtime together. I found that the analyzing runtime super useful because this is the algorithm how we can make our programs run faster and I've never done of thought of that in previous CSE courses.  

When we do critique and connect, it has a large difference from the CSE class I have taken before. We were only asked to write reflections on our codes but we did not how codes can influence us and our world. We wrote about how autocomplete is prioritizing bad results because it is showing results about extremist ideology which should be considered and solved at first, and we critiqued about the bad influence of deep fake technology which brings bad guys possibilities to bring false information to people. We've learned that technology can not only benefit people but also has adverse effects.  

These are what I've never thought about in previous CSE lessons. I will definitely think more of them in my future program development. And this is where my understanding of CS changed.

## What part of the course most changed me?
The part most changed me has to be the collaboration with others under the impact of the covid, and coping with sudden situations when teamwork. At the beginning is Winter 2022, the pandemic was extremely serious and we start a quarter by remote learning. It is my first time attending a class that involves a lot of group collaboration like this. While we are unable to meet in person, we are still working "together" online, discussing the codes and the presentation, but with a different form like discord to communicate and we used great collaboration tools like "code with me" in IntelliJ IDEA which was especially useful as we can code together online. While we plan to meet in person for one time before the project presentation, one teammate was reported positive and we can only cancel the plan which was to meet in the library. Though we prepared a lot, we still scheduled an online zoom meeting to do a pre-presentation to be well prepared for the real one. We were very much stressed because many days of our credits were summed up in one speech.  

I've found every group member I met super tied in on our projects. It was a smooth process to think of the codes, do the analysis, and think of critique and connect of projects with them. It was really pleasant to work with them. And, I'm very proud that I'm studying at UW, meeting great teammates to learn ideas together, and I started to love UW more than ever.  

Also, I felt the importance of self-learning in this course. As a 300-level CSE course, the contents are compact and everything here has a really fast pace. The professor leaves the most time of class for us to discuss the content, but there is only a few time that the professor can teach the contents in class. I spent quite a lot of time learning on Ed and searching for intuitional videos on YouTube and I learned quite a lot online. This learning pattern also changed me a lot because I found how useful those online resources are.  

## What's next?
I'm very much interested in web development like writing HTML and CSS, learning to use node.js, and more, and I started learning it now as I'm writing this website and pushing it to GitHub. It is definitely challenging for me as a beginner in web development but I will keep doing it in the future. I'm planning to take some web developing courses at UW like CSE 154 in the future. Also, I'm interested in computer architecture so I'm planning to learn content about it online.
