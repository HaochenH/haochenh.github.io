## About Me
My name is Haochen Hu and I am a student at the University of Washington's Information School. Through my coursework, I have developed a strong interest in data science, machine learning, data modeling, UX design, and web development. These fields have allowed me to combine my passion for technology with my love of problem-solving and design, and have given me the opportunity to explore a wide range of exciting and challenging projects.

I have gained experience working with a variety of data science and machine learning tools and techniques, and have developed a strong understanding of how to use these tools to extract insights from data and build predictive models. I have also had the opportunity to work on UX design and web development projects, where I have honed my skills in user-centered design and front-end development.

I am excited to continue learning and growing in these fields, and am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems. I am confident that my passion for technology and my dedication to continuous learning will enable me to make a valuable contribution to any team or organization.
