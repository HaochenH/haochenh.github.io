## Education
I am currently a student at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics: Data Science. I expect to graduate in June 2023. 

My relevant coursework includes Advanced Methods in Data Science, Databases and Data Modeling, Client-Side Development, Interactive Information Visualization, Information Ethics and Society, Elements Of Statistical Methods, and Interactive Information Visualization.	

In addition to my studies at the University of Washington, I have also attended summer session at Duke University, and took the Mathematics of the Universe course.

## Skills

**Data Science and Analytics:** I have experience working with data science and analytics tools and techniques, and am proficient in using them to extract insights from data. I have employed Python and R in various ways, such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

**Machine Learning:** I am proficient in Python, and I have a strong understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms with Python, and have experience applying these techniques to a variety of real-world problems, including spam prediction, and image classification.

**Web Development:** I am proficient in a range of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have experience building web applications and websites. I built a web application, Help Beat Hunger, for my final project in the Client-Side Development course, which allowed me to start applying my knowledge of web development to a real-world problem. During the capstone course of University of Washington, I undertook another project named "dService", where I continued to expand my web development capabilities. This project allowed me to further refine my skills and gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing a web-based solution. Through the development of this project, I not only expanded my web development capabilities but also gained a deeper understanding of the data science domain.

**System Maintenance and Operation:** I have prior experience with system maintenance and operation, which includes troubleshooting, diagnosing, and resolving technical issues, as well as ensuring that systems run smoothly. I am well-versed in a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, knowledge of various Linux distributions and hands-on experience with different Linux tools and commands, such as bash, Shell script, and more. I have worked with a wide range of hardware and software technologies, allowing me to effectively maintain and manage systems. 

## Interests
I am tech-savvy, with a strong interest in staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. I am a hands-on learner, with a proven ability to quickly acquire new skills and apply them in a practical setting. I am also open-minded, and willing to learn, which allows me to approach problems from multiple angles and find innovative solutions. 

I also have a personal interest in computer hardware and building computers. I have a strong curiosity about how computer systems work and enjoy learning about the latest technologies and components. This personal interest has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of technology and has helped me develop hands-on skills in computer hardware and software.

## Languages
